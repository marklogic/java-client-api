/**
 * <p>To facilitate long-running read, update, and delete use cases, coordinates
 * threads to process batches of uris matching a query or coming
 * from an Iterator.  Each batch of uris matching a query will come from a
 * single forest.  The host for that forest is the target of the DatabaseClient
 * provided to the listener's processEvent method.  The query is performed
 * directly on each forest associated with the database for the DatabaseClient
 * provided to DataMovementManager.  The end goal of each job is determined by
 * the listeners registered with onUrisReady.  The data set from which batches
 * are made and on which processing is performed is determined by the
 * {@link DataMovementManager#newQueryBatcher(StructuredQueryDefinition) query} or
 * {@link DataMovementManager#newQueryBatcher(Iterator) Iterator} used to
 * construct this instance.</p>
 *
 * While the most custom use cases will be addressed by custom listeners, the
 * common use cases are addressed by provided listeners, including
 * {@link com.marklogic.client.datamovement.ApplyTransformListener},
 * {@link com.marklogic.client.datamovement.DeleteListener},
 * {@link com.marklogic.client.datamovement.ExportListener}, and
 * {@link com.marklogic.client.datamovement.ExportToWriterListener}.  The provided
 * listeners are used by adding an instance via onUrisReady like so:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     QueryBatcher qhb = dataMovementManager.newQueryBatcher(query)
 *         .withConsistentSnapshot()
 *         .onUrisReady( new DeleteListener() )
 *         .onQueryFailure(exception -> exception.printStackTrace());
 *     JobTicket ticket = dataMovementManager.startJob(qhb);
 *     qhb.awaitCompletion();
 *     dataMovementManager.stopJob(ticket);
 *}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Custom listeners will generally use the [MarkLogic Java Client API][] to
 * manipulate the documents for the uris in each batch.</p>
 *
 * <p>QueryBatcher is designed to be highly scalable and performant.  To
 * accommodate the largest result sets, QueryBatcher paginates through
 * matches rather than loading matches into memory.  To prevent queueing too
 * many tasks when running a query, QueryBatcher only adds another task
 * when one completes the query and is about to send the matching uris to the
 * onUrisReady listeners.</p>
 *
 * <p>For pagination to succeed, you must not modify the result set during
 * pagination. This means you must</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>perform a read-only operation, or
 *   <li>make sure modifications do not modify the result set by deleting matches
 *    or modifying them to no longer match, or
 *   <li>set a
 *     <a href="https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/app-dev/point_in_time#id_32468">merge timestamp</a>
 *     and use {@link #withConsistentSnapshot}, or
 *   <li>use {@link DataMovementManager#newQueryBatcher(Iterator) Iterator}
 *    instead of a {@link
 *    DataMovementManager#newQueryBatcher(StructuredQueryDefinition) query}.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Sample usage using withConsistentSnapshot():</p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     QueryDefinition query = new StructuredQueryBuilder().collection("myCollection");
 *     QueryBatcher qhb = dataMovementManager.newQueryBatcher(query)
 *         .withBatchSize(1000)
 *         .withThreadCount(20)
 *         .withConsistentSnapshot()
 *         .onUrisReady(batch -> {
 *             for ( String uri : batch.getItems() ) {
 *                 if ( uri.endsWith(".txt") ) {
 *                     client.newDocumentManager().delete(uri);
 *                 }
 *             }
 *         })
 *         .onQueryFailure(exception -> exception.printStackTrace());
 *     JobTicket ticket = dataMovementManager.startJob(qhb);
 *     qhb.awaitCompletion();
 *     dataMovementManager.stopJob(ticket);
 *}</pre>
 *
 * Example of queueing uris in memory instead of using withConsistentSnapshot():
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     ArrayList<String> uris = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());
 *     QueryBatcher getUris = dataMovementManager.newQueryBatcher(query)
 *       .withBatchSize(5000)
 *       .onUrisReady( batch -> uris.addAll(Arrays.asList(batch.getItems())) )
 *       .onQueryFailure(exception -> exception.printStackTrace());
 *     JobTicket getUrisTicket = dataMovementManager.startJob(getUris);
 *     getUris.awaitCompletion();
 *     dataMovementManager.stopJob(getUrisTicket);
 *
 *     // now we have the uris, let's step through them
 *     QueryBatcher performDelete = moveMgr.newQueryBatcher(uris.iterator())
 *       .onUrisReady(new DeleteListener())
 *       .onQueryFailure(exception -> exception.printStackTrace());
 *     JobTicket ticket = dataMovementManager.startJob(performDelete);
 *     performDelete.awaitCompletion();
 *     dataMovementManager.stopJob(ticket);
 *}</pre>
 *
 * To queue uris to disk (if not enough memory is available) see {@link UrisToWriterListener}.
