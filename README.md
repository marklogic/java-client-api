# The MarkLogic Java Client API

The API makes it easy to write, read, delete, and find documents
in a [MarkLogic](http://developer.marklogic.com/) database.

The Java API supports the following core features of the MarkLogic database:

*  Write and read binary, JSON, text, and XML documents.
*  Query data structure trees, marked-up text, and all the hybrids in between those extremes.
*  Project values and tuples from hierarchical documents and aggregate over them.
*  Patch documents with partial updates.
*  Match documents against alerting rules expressed as queries. 
*  Use Optimistic Locking to detect contention without creating locks on the server.
*  Execute ACID modifications so the change either succeeds or throws an exception.
*  Execute multi-statement transactions so changes to multiple documents succeed or fail together.

### QuickStart

For people working with MarkLogic 8 EA

    $ mvn test-compile
    $ sh src/test/resources/boot-test.sh
    $ mvn test

### Learning More

The following resources introduce and document the Java API:

* [The Java API in Five Minutes](http://developer.marklogic.com/try/java/index)
* [Java Application Developer's Guide](http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/java)
* [JavaDoc](http://docs.marklogic.com/javadoc/client/index.html)

### Installing

To use the Java API, either add a Maven dependency or download the jar and its dependencies:

Of course, you'll also need to install the database -- which you can do for free with
the developer license:

### Building

You can build the API in the same way as any Maven project on git:

1. Clone the java-client-api repository on your machine.
2. Execute a Maven build in the directory containing the pom.xml file.  

You might want to skip the tests until you have configured a test database and REST server:

    $ mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
