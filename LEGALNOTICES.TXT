                                 Apache License
                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

A large portion of the dictionary entries
originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.

Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.

NO WARRANTY

The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
research and development conducted during the project and is provided
to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
any right of any third party.

Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.

Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
production of secondary products from the program.

In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
above as far as the program is concerned.

(CCAL v2.5)
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

"Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
the purposes of this License.
"Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
License.
"Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
of this License.
"Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
"Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
this License.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
this License despite a previous violation.
2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
incorporated in Collective Works;
to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive
right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g.
ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right
to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated
agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the
Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created
by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
jurisdictions).
Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject
to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act
(or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective
Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If
You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
clause 4(b), as requested.
If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor
designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity,
journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work
if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
above.
8. Miscellaneous

Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
make such provision valid and enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not
be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
the Licensor and You.

License Text (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php)
Eclipse Public License, Version 1.0 (EPL-1.0)
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE 
("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES 
RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation 
distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed 
by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it 
was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such 
Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) 
are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under 
their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are 
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined 
with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all 
Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a 
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare 
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the 
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code 
and object code form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a 
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, 
use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such 
Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall 
apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the 
Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes 
such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not 
apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is 
licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its 
Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the 
Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any 
other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought 
by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or 
otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, 
each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual 
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is 
required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's 
responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright 
rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this 
Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own 
license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, 
express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, 
and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular 
purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, 
including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as 
lost profits;
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that 
Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and 
informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium 
customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the 
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, 
in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of 
the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect 
to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to 
facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program 
in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create 
potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the 
Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") 
hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified 
Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising 
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the 
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such 
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a 
commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any 
claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the 
Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial 
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense 
and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate 
in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, 
Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial 
Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, 
those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's 
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to 
defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and 
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a 
result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" 
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is 
solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the 
Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this 
Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, 
compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and 
unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY 
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, 
EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), 
HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, 
OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR 
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, 
it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of 
this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall 
be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and 
enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim 
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations 
of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), 
then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date 
such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with 
any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such 
failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If 
all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use 
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, 
Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient 
relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to 
avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the 
following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions 
(including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the 
Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is 
the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to 
serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the 
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including 
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under 
which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, 
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under 
the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient 
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under 
this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights 
in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual 
property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a 
legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. 
Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

CentOS Support Service Agreement for Windows Azure
This OpenLogic Support Agreement is a legal agreement between OpenLogic, Inc., a 
Delaware Corporation ("OpenLogic") and you, either an individual or an entity ("you"). 
If you are an individual, you represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into 
contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into this agreement on 
behalf of an entity, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that 
entity.  

This agreement governs the support services ("Services") provided to you by OpenLogic 
for designated open source software stacks made available by OpenLogic on Windows 
Azure ("OSS Stacks"). This agreement is effective as of the date you purchased support 
for the OSS Stack(s) ("Effective Date").   

1.   Support Services

OpenLogic will provide technical support for the specific OSS Stacks that Windows 
Azure reports to OpenLogic you have purchased commencing on the Effective Date.  
Technical support includes assistance with problem resolution, defects, and "how to" 
questions as well as advice and recommendations on installation and configuration.  
Support for OSS Stacks will cover only Windows Azure instances on which the stack is 
deployed through the Windows Azure.  It will not cover support of the Windows Azure 
infrastructure or support for the OSS Stacks running on other infrastructure. 

OpenLogic will provide support 12 hours per day between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM EST / EDT, 
five days per week for Developer Support and 24 hours per day, seven days per week for 
Production Support.  Technical support incidents can be submitted via email or by 
phone.  Each single unique defect or question about a Purchased Stack will be counted 
as an incident.  Unless otherwise indicated at the time of purchase, you may submit an 
unlimited number of technical support incidents.  Details about the technical support 
process, response times, types of issues, and severity of issues can be found here 
www.roguewave.com/products-services/services/open-source-software/cloud-
services/azure/service-agreement.

2.   Limitations on Support 

OpenLogic will have no obligation to provide technical support or may cease providing 
the Services in the case of or with respect to any incident that is in whole or in 
part due to, caused by, or resulting from any of the following:

 (i) a breach by you of this Agreement;

 (ii) the operational characteristics of Windows Azure provided hardware, instances, 
or infrastructure;

 (iii) any third party products, software, hardware, equipment, content, data or 
information, and any modifications, improvements, updates, new versions or new 
releases thereto or thereof, not provided by OpenLogic;

 (v) any OSS Stack other than the most current release thereof made available by 
OpenLogic through Windows Azure;

 (vi) use of any OSS Stack after OpenLogic has notified you to cease use thereof under 
this Agreement; or

 (vii) your negligence, abuse, misapplication, or misuse of the OSS Stacks or the 
Services.  

OpenLogic will have no liability for any changes required by your hardware or software 
configuration which may be necessary to use any OSS Stack due to a workaround, error 
correction, or maintenance release.

3.   Fees, Term, and Termination

You will be billed by Windows Azure under the terms of the Windows Azure Customer 
Agreement.  The term of this agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will 
remain in effect until terminated by you or Windows Azure as per the Windows Azure 
Customer Agreement.  The Windows Azure Customer Agreement is located at 
www.roguewave.com/products-services/services/open-source-software/cloud-
services/azure/service-agreement/.

4.   Intellectual Property Rights

 4.1. Intellectual Property Rights.  Intellectual property rights includes, without 
limitation, all copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, patents, moral 
rights, and any and all other legal rights protecting intangible proprietary 
information ("IPR").  All pre-existing intellectual property rights owned or licensed 
by either party are and will remain the exclusive property of that party.

 4.2. License.  During the term of this Agreement, you may choose to provide OpenLogic 
with access to Your IPR to facilitate OpenLogic in providing the Services, in which 
case you grant to OpenLogic all rights and licenses in and to the Your Technology as 
may be necessary for OpenLogic to complete its obligations under this Agreement.  It 
should be noted that OpenLogic does not have access to Your Technology deployed on 
Windows Azure unless you choose to give OpenLogic access as part of providing the 
Services.  OpenLogic hereby grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide 
license to use, reproduce, and modify any OpenLogic IPR provided to you during the 
course of performing the Services for your own internal business purposes.  To the 
extent any deliverable hereunder is a derivative work, modification, patch, or script 
of or directly relating to an open source software project (each an "Open Source 
Deliverable"), OpenLogic will license such Open Source Deliverable under the same open 
source software license as the open source project to which it relates.

 4.3. OSS Stacks License. The OSS Stacks are comprised of open source software, which 
is subject to the terms of the open source software license(s) accompanying or 
otherwise applicable to that open source software.  Any other code created and 
supplied directly by OpenLogic is governed by the MIT License.  The terms of the open 
source software licenses apply to the open source software independent of the terms of 
the MIT License or this agreement.  Nothing in this agreement limits your rights under 
or grants rights to you that supersede the terms of any applicable open source 
software license. 

 4.4. You acknowledge that your own distribution or deployment of instances containing 
or linking to the OSS Stacks or any other open source software may trigger open source 
license requirements for which you are responsible.

 4.5. Open Source Community. In the process of providing the Services, OpenLogic 
occasionally finds bugs and errors in open source software as well as issues in how 
certain open source packages work together.  OpenLogic will make best efforts to work 
with open source communities to resolve bugs or defects and contribute those changes 
back for incorporation in future releases.   Due to the nature of open source 
development, OpenLogic can not guarantee that the open source communities will accept 
bug fixes. 

5.   Customer's Comments and Feedback

In the course of OpenLogic providing you with technical support, you may provide 
comments, suggestions, and other feedback regarding the OSS Stacks, the support 
services, or related topics to OpenLogic. You agree that OpenLogic will be free to use 
any such feedback you provide for any purpose, including without limitation 
implementing changes based on your feedback to the OSS Stacks, support,, or other 
offerings without attribution or compensation to you.

6.   Warranties. 

 6.1. General.  Each party represents and warrants to the other party that: the 
performance of such party's obligations hereunder do not and will not violate any law, 
rule or regulation applicable to such party. 

 6.2. OpenLogic.  OpenLogic will perform all Services as stated under this Agreement.  
If OpenLogic fails to comply with the previous sentence, OpenLogic will, at its sole 
discretion and as Client's sole remedy and OpenLogic's sole obligation for any such 
failure: (a) re-perform the Services in a manner that resolves the alleged failure; or 
(b) refund any Fees paid by Client attributable to the Services that are the subject 
of the failure. 

7.   Disclaimer

THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 (Warranties) ARE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE 
WARRANTIES MADE BY OPENLOGIC UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND OPENLOGIC SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS 
ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, WITH 
REGARD TO THE SERVICES, DELIVERABLES AND ANY OTHER SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, 
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, FITNESS FOR 
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, FUNCTIONALITY OR MERCHANTABILITY. 

8.   Limitation of Liability

OPENLOGIC WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT (HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
INCLUDING, BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, AND 
INJURY TO REPUTATION, EVEN IF OPENLOGIC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES.  THE TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY OF OPENLOGIC RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, 
REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT 
EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID TO AMAZON BY CLIENT FOR SUPPORT PROVIDED BY OPENLOGIC 
DURING THE 3 MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT(S) GIVING RISE TO SUCH 
LIABILITY. 

9.   Confidential Information.

 9.1. Confidential Information.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential 
Information" means any data or information regarding the business, finances, services 
or technology of either party provided to or otherwise obtained by the other party, 
including, without limitation, technical, marketing, financial, pricing, employee, and 
planning information, and any other data or information received or otherwise obtained 
under this Agreement that a reasonable person should have known, under the 
circumstances, was confidential or proprietary. 

 9.2. Protection.  Each party (the "Receiving Party") may from time to time receive or 
otherwise obtain Confidential Information from the other party (the "Disclosing 
Party").  The Receiving Party will not use any Confidential Information of the 
Disclosing Party for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement, and will 
disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only to the employees or 
contractors of the Receiving Party who have a need to know such Confidential 
Information for purposes of this Agreement and who are under a duty of confidentiality 
no less restrictive than the Receiving Party's duty hereunder.  The Receiving Party 
will protect the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information in the same manner as the 
Receiving Party protects its own confidential information of a similar nature and with 
no less than reasonable care.

 9.3. Exceptions.  The Receiving Party's obligations with respect to any Confidential 
Information of the Disclosing Party will terminate if such information: (a) was 
already lawfully known to the Receiving Party as of the Effective Date; (b) is 
disclosed to the Receiving Party after the Effective Date by a third party who had the 
right to make such disclosure without any confidentiality restrictions; (c) is, or 
through no fault of the Receiving Party becomes, generally available to the public; or 
(d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without access to, use of, or 
reference to, the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.  In addition, the 
Receiving Party will be allowed to disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing 
Party to the extent that such disclosure is: (i) necessary for the Receiving Party to 
enforce its rights under this Agreement in connection with a legal proceeding; or (ii) 
required by law or by the order of a court of similar judicial, regulatory or 
administrative body, provided that the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party 
in advance of such required disclosure promptly and in writing and cooperates with the 
Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party's reasonable request and expense, in any 
lawful action to contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure.

10. General

 10.1. Export.    You will comply with all applicable export and import laws and 
regulations in your use of the OSS Stacks.  You represent that you are not barred from 
receiving services under U.S. laws or other applicable jurisdiction, including without 
limitations, the Denied Persons List and the Entity List, and other lists issued by 
the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security.  You represent that 
you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country 
to which the United States has embargoed goods.

 10.2.      Assignment.  This agreement, or any of your rights and obligations under 
this agreement, cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part, and 
any such attempted assignment or transfer by Customer in violation of the foregoing 
will be null and void.

 10.3.      Choice of law.  This agreement will be governed by the laws of the State 
of Colorado in the United States of America, without regard to conflicts of law 
principles.  The federal and state courts located in Denver, Colorado (and any other 
courts having jurisdiction over matters arising in Denver, Colorado) will have 
exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising under this agreement and the parties 
hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.  The parties 
agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of 
Goods is specifically excluded from application to this agreement.

 10.4.      Relationship of parties.  This agreement does not create a partnership, 
franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between you 
and OpenLogic. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this agreement.

 10.5.      Waiver.  All waivers under this agreement must be in writing.  Any waiver 
or failure to enforce any provision of this agreement on one occasion will not be 
deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.

 10.6.      Severability.  If any provision of this agreement is held to be 
unenforceable, that provision will be modified so as to be enforceable, or if such 
modification is not possible, that provision will be removed and the remaining 
provisions will remain in full force.

 10.7.      Survival.  Sections 4 (Intellectual Property Rights), 5 (Customer's 
Comments and Feedback), 7 (Disclaimer), 8 (Limitation of Liability), 9 (Confidential 
Information), and 10 (General) will survive termination or expiration of this 
agreement.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, 
but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor 
of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and 
change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your 
freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all 
its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated 
software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other 
authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think 
carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the 
better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our 
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you 
receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and 
use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these 
things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny 
you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate 
to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you 
must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that 
they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the 
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can 
relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. 
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) 
we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or 
modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty 
for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, 
the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that 
the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be 
introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. 
We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free 
program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist 
that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with 
the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General 
Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to 
certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those 
libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, 
the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the 
original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking 
only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public 
License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to 
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides 
other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. 
These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many 
libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special 
circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest 
possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve 
this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is 
that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, 
there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use 
the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a 
greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission 
to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the 
whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, 
it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the 
freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the 
Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. 
Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a 
"work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, 
whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which 
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it 
may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called 
"this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be 
conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and 
data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been 
distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library 
or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without 
limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications 
to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules 
it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this 
License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is 
not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents 
constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a 
tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what 
the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code 
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately 
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep 
intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; 
and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your 
option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or 
work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you 
changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third 
parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be 
supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument 
passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure 
that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility 
still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is 
entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d 
requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be 
optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still 
compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of 
that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered 
independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, 
the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions 
for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part 
regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to 
work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control 
the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the 
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution 
medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead 
of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the 
notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General 
Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than 
version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can 
specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these 
notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the 
ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative 
works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a 
program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under 
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above 
provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated 
place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place 
satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are 
not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is 
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a 
"work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of 
the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable 
that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), 
rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by 
this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of 
the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even 
though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the 
work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The 
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and 
accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), 
then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library 
will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object 
code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work 
also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that 
uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the 
Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms 
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for 
debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in 
it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a 
copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you 
must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for 
the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be 
distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as 
object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then 
relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library 
will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified 
definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable 
mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on 
the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, 
and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user 
installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version 
that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more 
than the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated 
place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same 
place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you 
have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include 
any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, 
as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that 
is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components 
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, 
unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other 
proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a 
contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable 
that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side 
in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this 
License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate 
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is 
otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, 
uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms 
of the Sections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a 
work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined 
form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except 
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, 
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long 
as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, 
nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its 
derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the 
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and 
conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the 
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, 
distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You 
may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights 
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with 
this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or 
for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you 
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you 
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License 
and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free 
redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly 
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular 
circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a 
whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other 
property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the 
sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system 
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous 
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in 
reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to 
decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a 
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence 
of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries 
either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who 
places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or 
among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the 
limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit 
to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a 
version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have 
the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not 
specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the 
Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose 
distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write 
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision 
will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of 
our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 
LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN 
WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE 
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY 
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS 
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE 
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE 
WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to 
the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and 
change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, 
alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to 
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion 
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to 
where the full notice is found.

one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does. 
Copyright (C) year name of author

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the 
terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software 
Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY 
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with 
this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, 
Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Also add information on how to contact you by 
electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if 
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; 
alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in

License for the JUnit package
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set
forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set
forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
License for the JUnit package
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

i) changes to the Program, and

ii) additions to the Program;

where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.

"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
derivative works, in source code and object code form.

b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
before distributing the Program.

d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set
forth in this Agreement.

3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

b) its license agreement:

i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;

ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
damages, such as lost profits;

iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

When the Program is made available in source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of
program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve
as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the
Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement
is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections
2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE) 7 
Attribution Statements
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/

The Java(TM) Platform, Standard Edition Runtime Environment (JRE) is 
intended for software developers and vendors to redistribute with
their applications.

The Java SE Runtime Environment contains the Java virtual machine,
runtime class libraries, and Java application launcher that are
necessary to run programs written in the Java programming language.
It is not a development environment and does not contain development
tools such as compilers or debuggers.  For development tools, see the
Java SE Development Kit (JDK(TM)).


=======================================================================
     Deploying Applications with the Java SE Runtime Environment
=======================================================================

When you deploy an application written in the Java programming
language, your software bundle will probably consist of the following
parts:

    Your own class, resource, and data files.
    A runtime environment.
    An installation procedure or program.

You already have the first part, of course. The remainder of this
document covers the other two parts. Also see the Developers website:

    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Runtime Environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To run your application, a user needs the Java SE Runtime Environment,
which is freely available from Oracle. Or, you can redistribute the
Java SE Runtime Environment for free with your application, according
to the terms of the Oracle Binary Code License Agreement for the Java 
SE Platform Products.

The final step in the deployment process occurs when the software is
installed on an individual user's system. Installation consists of copying
software onto the user's system, then configuring the user's system
to support that software.  You should ensure that your installation
procedure does not overwrite existing JRE installations, as they may
be required by other applications.


=======================================================================
      Redistribution of the Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE)
=======================================================================

    --------------------------------------------------------
    NOTE - The license for this software does not allow the
    redistribution of beta and other pre-release versions.
    --------------------------------------------------------

You may reproduce and distribute the Software (and also portions of
Software identified below as Redistributable), provided that you comply
with the terms and conditions of the Oracle Binary Code License
Agreement for the Java SE Platform Products.

The term "vendors" used here refers to licensees, developers, and
independent software vendors (ISVs) who license and distribute the
Java SE Runtime Environment with their programs.

Vendors must follow the terms of the Java SE Runtime Environment Binary
Code License agreement.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Required vs. Optional Files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The files that make up the Java SE Runtime Environment are divided into
two categories: required and optional.  Optional files may be excluded
from redistributions of the Java SE Runtime Environment at the
vendor's discretion.

The following section contains a list of the files and directories that
may optionally be omitted from redistributions with the Java SE Runtime
Environment.  All files not in these lists of optional files must be
included in redistributions of the runtime environment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Optional Files and Directories
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following files may be optionally excluded from redistributions.
These files are located in the jre1.7.0_<version> directory, where
<version> is the update version number.  Solaris and Linux filenames
and separators are shown. Windows executables have the ".exe" suffix.
Corresponding files with _g in the name can also be excluded.
The corresponding man pages should be excluded for any excluded
executables (with paths listed below beginning with bin/ , 
for the Solaris(TM) Operating System and Linux). 

   lib/ext/
   sunjce_provider.jar,sunec.jar, sunpkcs11.jar and sunmscapi.jar - JCA/JCE 
   providers for Java Cryptography APIs. Some providers
   are not available on all OS or Architectures. The
   runtime environment must contain at least one implementation
   of each of the required Security algorithms as described in:
   http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/
   security/StandardNames.html
           
   localedata.jar - contains many of the resources 
                    needed for non US English locales
   dnsns.jar - for the InetAddress wrapper of JNDI DNS provider
   bin/rmid [.exe, and .dll on Microsoft Windows]
   Java RMI Activation System Daemon
   bin/rmiregistry
   Java Remote Object Registry
   bin/tnameserv

When redistributing the JRE on Microsoft Windows as a private
application runtime (not accessible by other applications)
with a custom launcher, the following files are also
optional.  These are libraries and executables that are used
for Java support in Internet Explorer and Mozilla family browsers;
these files are not needed in a private JRE redistribution.

    bin\java.exe
    bin\javaw.exe
    bin\javaws.exe
    bin\javacpl.exe
    bin\jucheck.exe

    lib\deploy\splash.jpg 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Redistributable JDK(TM) Files
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The limited set of files from the Java SE Development Kit (JDK)
listed below may be included in vendor redistributions of the Java SE 
Runtime Environment.  All paths are relative to the top-level
directory of the JDK. The corresponding man pages should be included for
any included executables (with paths listed below beginning with bin/ ,
for the Solaris(TM) Operating System and Linux). 

    jre/lib/cmm/PYCC.pf
        Color profile.  This file is required only if one wishes to
        convert between the PYCC color space and another color space.

    All .ttf font files in the jre/lib/fonts directory. 
        Note that the LucidaSansRegular.ttf font is already contained 
        in the Java SE Runtime Environment, so there is no need to 
        bring that file over from the JDK.

    The javac bytecode compiler, consisting of the following files:
        bin/javac           [Solaris(TM) Operating System
                             and Linux]
        bin/sparcv9/javac   [Solaris Operating System
                             (SPARC(R) Platform Edition)]
    bin/amd64/javac     [Solaris Operating System (AMD)]
        bin/javac.exe       [Microsoft Windows]
        lib/tools.jar       [All platforms]

    The Annotation Processing Tool, consisting of the following files:
        bin/apt             [Solaris(TM) Operating System
                             and Linux]
        bin/sparcv9/apt     [Solaris Operating System
                             (SPARC(R) Platform Edition)]
    bin/amd64/apt       [Solaris Operating System (AMD)]
        bin/apt.exe         [Microsoft Windows]

    lib/jconsole.jar
        The Jconsole application.

    jre\bin\server\
        On Microsoft Windows platforms, the JDK includes both
        the Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM and Java HotSpot Client VM.
        However, the Java SE Runtime Environment for Microsoft Windows
        platforms includes only the Java HotSpot Client VM. Those wishing
        to use the Java HotSpot Server VM with the Java SE Runtime
        Environment may copy the JDK's jre\bin\server folder to a 
        bin\server directory in the Java SE Runtime Environment. Software
        vendors may redistribute the Java HotSpot Server VM with their
        redistributions of the Java SE Runtime Environment.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlimited Strength Java Cryptography Extension
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to import control restrictions for some countries, the Java
Cryptography Extension (JCE) policy files shipped with the Java SE
Development Kit and the Java SE Runtime Environment allow strong but
limited cryptography to be used.  These files are located at

     <java-home>/lib/security/local_policy.jar
     <java-home>/lib/security/US_export_policy.jar

where <java-home> is the jre directory of the JDK or the
top-level directory of the Java SE Runtime Environment.

An unlimited strength version of these files indicating no restrictions
on cryptographic strengths is available on the JDK web site for
those living in eligible countries.  Those living in eligible countries
may download the unlimited strength version and replace the strong
cryptography jar files with the unlimited strength files.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The cacerts Certificates File
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Root CA certificates may be added to or removed from the Java SE
certificate file located at 

    <java-home>/lib/security/cacerts

For more information, see "The cacerts Certificates File" section
in the keytool documentation at:

http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security

=======================================================================
Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism
=======================================================================

From time to time it is necessary to update the Java platform in order
to incorporate newer versions of standards that are created outside of
the Java Community Process(SM) (JCP(SM) http://www.jcp.org/) (Endorsed
Standards), or in order to update the version of a technology included
in the platform to correspond to a later standalone version of that
technology (Standalone Technologies).

The Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism provides a means whereby
later versions of classes and interfaces that implement Endorsed
Standards or Standalone Technologies may be incorporated into the Java
Platform.

For more information on the Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism,
including the list of platform packages that it may be used to
override, see

3.1. Availability of Source Code. 
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable 
form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be 
distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this 
License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute 
or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software 
in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form 
in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications. 
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms 
of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original 
creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this 
License.

3.3. Required Notices. 
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the 
Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or 
trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing 
or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial 
Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. 
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that 
alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights 
hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. 
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial 
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You 
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms 
different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of 
this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or 
alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this 
License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this 
License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You 
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any 
such terms You offer.

distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than 
the license steward has the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions. 
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software 
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally 
received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the 
Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available 
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered 
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, 
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any 
subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions. 
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your 
Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: 
(a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward 
(except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it 
clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY 
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES 
THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY 
RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF 
ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES 
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED 
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You 
fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of 
becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect 
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment 
actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or 
Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") 
alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the 
Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the 
Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all 
rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial 
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under 
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant 
terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice 
period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to 
the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a 
written agreement with Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user 
licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to 
termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive 
termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR 
ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE 
TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY 
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, 
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL 
DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR 
PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION 
OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY 
TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 
2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that term is 
defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software 
documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent 
with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all 
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth 
herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other 
FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer 
software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If 
any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be 
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be 
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the 
Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), 
excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to 
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the 
jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, 
with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court 
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly 
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall 
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You 
alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration 
regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when 
You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for 
claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights 
under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to 
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or 
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for infringements 
caused by: (i) third party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the 
combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except as 
part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims 
infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by that 
Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code. 
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable 
form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be 
distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this 
License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute 
or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software 
in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form 
in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications. 
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms 
of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original 
creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this 
License.

3.3. Required Notices. 
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the 
Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or 
trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing 
or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial 
Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. 
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that 
alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights 
hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. 
However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial 
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You 
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of 
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this 
License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms 
different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of 
this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or 
alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this 
License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this 
License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You 
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any 
such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works. 
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not 
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single 
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are 
fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions. 
Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of 
this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version 
number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has 
the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions. 
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software 
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally 
received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the 
Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available 
under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered 
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, 
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any 
subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions. 
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your 
Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: 
(a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward 
(except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it 
clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. 
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY 
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES 
THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY 
RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF 
ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES 
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED 
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You 
fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of 
becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect 
beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment 
actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or 
Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") 
alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the 
Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the 
Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all 
rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial 
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under 
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant 
terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice 
period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to 
the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a 
written agreement with Participant.

6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the 
Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is 
resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such 
Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the 
amount or value of any payment or license.

6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user 
licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to 
termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive 
termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR 
ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE 
TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY 
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, 
EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY 
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH 
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL 
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 
2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that term is 
defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software 
documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent 
with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all 
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth 
herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other 
FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer 
software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If 
any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be 
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be 
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the 
Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), 
excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to 
this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the 
jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, 
with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court 
costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly 
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall 
be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You 
alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration 
regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when 
You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for 
claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights 
under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to 
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or 
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) 
The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of 
California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this 
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern 
District of California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue 
lying in Santa Clara County, California.

2. License Grants and Conditions
2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

    under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by 
such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, 
distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, 
with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

    under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have 
made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor 
Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective 
for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. 
No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of 
Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent 
license is granted by a Contributor:

    for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

    for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of 
Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software 
(except as part of its Contributor Version); or

    under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its 
Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of 
any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in 
Section 3.4).
2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the 
Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or 
under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its 
original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its 
Contributions conveyed by this License.
2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright 
doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.
3. Responsibilities
3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications 
that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. 
You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is 
governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. 
You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code 
Form.
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

    such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as 
described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how 
they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely 
manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

    You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or 
sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form 
does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form 
under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that 
You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the 
Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more 
Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary 
Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software 
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work 
may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of 
either this License or such Secondary License(s).
3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright 
notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) 
contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may 
alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may 
do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it 
absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation 
is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and 
limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with 
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or 
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum 
extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such 
description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the 
Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or 
regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary 
skill to be able to understand it.
5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to 
comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights 
granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) 
provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates 
Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of 
the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back 
into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on 
an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some 
reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance 
with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days 
after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement 
claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) 
alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then 
the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under 
Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license 
agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by 
You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive 
termination.
6. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty 
of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, 
warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a 
particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and 
performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove 
defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary 
servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential 
part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License 
except under this disclaimer.
7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), 
contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered 
Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, 
incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, 
damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party 
shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of 
liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from 
such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some 
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential 
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
8. Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a 
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such 
litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its 
conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to 
bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
9. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. 
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be 
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation 
which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter 
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
10. Versions of the License
10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one 
other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this 
License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License 
under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any 
subsequent version published by the license steward.
10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new 
license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License 
if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward 
(except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary 
Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in 
Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

    This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 
2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at 
http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You 
may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) 
where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice

    This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as defined by the 
Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and does not 
provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public 
licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons makes 
its licenses and related information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons 
gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their terms 
and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability 
for damages resulting from their use to the fullest extent possible.
Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that 
creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and 
other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public 
license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are 
not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those 
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted 
by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should 
read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before 
applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our 
licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should 
clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed 
material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More 
considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants 
the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and 
conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason-for example, 
because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright-then that use is not 
regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and 
certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed 
material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have 
copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such 
as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our 
licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More 
considerations for the public.

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by 
the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public 
License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a 
contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of 
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration 
of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under 
these terms and conditions.

Section 1 - Definitions.

a.	Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that 
is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material 
is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner 
requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For 
purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, 
performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the 
Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.

b.	Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar 
Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and

Section 2 - Scope.

a.	License grant.

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby 
grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable 
license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and 
Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need 
to comply with its terms and conditions.

3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to 
exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter 
created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives 
and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical 
modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical 
modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes 
of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) 
never produces Adapted Material.

5. Downstream recipients.

A. Offer from the Licensor - Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed 
Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed 
Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different 
terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed 
Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the 
Licensed Material.

6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as 
permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material 
is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the 
Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 
3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. Other rights.

1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public 
License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, 
to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such 
rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise 
the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You 
for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting 
society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In 
all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 - License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following 
conditions.

a.	Attribution.

1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:

i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated 
to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including 
by pseudonym if designated);

ii. a copyright notice;

iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

iv.	a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;

B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any 
previous modifications; and

C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include 
the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.

2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on 
the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, 
it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a 
resource that includes the required information.

3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by 
Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not 
prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.

Section 4 - Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use 
of the Licensed Material:

a.	for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, 
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the 
database;

b.	if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a 
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You 
have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted 
Material; and

c.	You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a 
substantial portion of the contents of the database. 
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your 
obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other 
Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 - Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a.	Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent 
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes 
no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether 
express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties 
of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence 
of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or 
not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or 
in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

b.	To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any 
legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, 
special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, 
costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed 
Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, 
costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or 
in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

c.	The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall 
be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an 
absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 - Term and Termination.

a.	This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights 
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your 
rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 
6(a), it reinstates:

1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 
days of Your discovery of the violation; or

2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

c.	For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the 
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

d.	For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material 
under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any 
time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

e.	Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 - Other Terms and Conditions.

a.	The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or 
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b.	Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed 
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and 
conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 - Interpretation.

a.	For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be 
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the 
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public 
License.

b.	To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed 
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to 
make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from 
this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and 
conditions.

c.	No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to 
comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d.	Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a 
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the 
Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
