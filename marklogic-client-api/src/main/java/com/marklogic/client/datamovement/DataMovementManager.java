/**
 * <p>DataMovementManager is the starting point for getting new instances of
 * QueryBatcher, WriteBatcher and RowBatcher, configured with a DatabaseClient and
 * ForestConfiguration.  On instantiation, it will immediately call
 * readForestConfig to obtain the ForestConfiguration from which it can create
 * host-specific DatabaseClient instances for each applicable host.  Applicable
 * hosts are those with forests for the database specified in the
 * DatabaseClient.  If not specified, the database is the default database for
 * the port in the DatabaseClient.  Call {@link #release()
 * dataMovementMangaer.release()} when you're done with your
 * DataMovementManager instance to free resources associated with those
 * host-specific DatabaseClient instances.</p>
 *
 * Sample Usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     DataMovementManager dataMovementManager = databaseClient.newDataMovementManager();
 *     WriteBatcher batcher = dataMovementManager.newWriteBatcher();
 *     dataMovementManager.startJob(batcher);
 *     . . .
 *     dataMovementManager.stopJob(batcher);
 *     dataMovementManager.release();
