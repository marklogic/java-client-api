  * Returns a query matching elements by name which has specific attributes representing latitude and longitude values for a point contained within the given geographic box, circle, or polygon, or equal to the given point. Points that lie between the southern boundary and the northern boundary of a box, travelling northwards, and between the western boundary and the eastern boundary of the box, travelling eastwards, will match. Points contained within the given radius of the center point of a circle will match, using the curved distance on the surface of the Earth.

  * Returns a query matching elements by name which has specific element children representing latitude and longitude values for a point contained within the given geographic box, circle, or polygon, or equal to the given point.

Points contained within the given radius of the center point of a circle will match, using the curved distance on the surface of the Earth.

The default value for this option will be 4096.  "limit-check" Specifies that an error will be raised if the lexicon expansion exceeds the specified limit. "no-limit-check" Specifies that error will not be raised if the lexicon expansion exceeds the specified limit. The server will try to resolve the wildcard.    (of <a href="{@docRoot}/doc-files/types/xs_string.html">xs:string</a>)
  * @param weight  A weight for this query. Higher weights move search results up in the relevance order. The default is 1.0. The weight should be between 64 and -16. Weights greater than 64 will have the same effect as a weight of 64. Weights less than the absolute value of 0.0625 (between -0.0625 and 0.0625) are rounded to 0, which means that they do not contribute to the score.

Shorthand for "case-sensitive", "diacritic-sensitive", "punctuation-sensitive", "whitespace-sensitive", "unstemmed", and "unwildcarded".  "lang=iso639code" Specifies the language of the query. The iso639code code portion is case-insensitive, and uses the languages specified by ISO 639. The default is specified in the database configuration. "distance-weight=number" A weight applied based on the minimum distance between matches of this query. Higher weights add to the importance of proximity (as opposed to term matches) when the relevance order is calculated. The default value is 0.0 (no impact of proximity). The weight should be between 64 and -16. Weights greater than 64 will have the same effect as a weight of 64. This parameter has no effect if the word positions index is not enabled. This parameter has no effect on searches that use score-simple or score-random (because those scoring algorithms do not consider term frequency, proximity is irrelevant).  "min-occurs=number" Specifies the minimum number of occurrences required. If fewer that this number of words occur, the fragment does not match. The default is 1. "max-occurs=number" Specifies the maximum number of occurrences required. If more than this number of words occur, the fragment does not match. The default is unbounded. "synonym" Specifies that all of the terms in the $text parameter are considered synonyms for scoring purposes. The result is that occurrences of more than one of the synonyms are scored as if there are more occurrences of the same term (as opposed to having a separate term that contributes to score).  "lexicon-expansion-limit=number" Specifies the limit for lexicon expansion. This puts a restriction on the number of lexicon expansions that can be performed. If the limit is exceeded, the server may raise an error depending on whether the "limit-check" option is set. The default value for this option will be 4096.

  * @param fieldName  One or more field names to search over. If multiple field names are supplied, the match can be in any of the specified fields (or-query semantics).  (of <a href="{@docRoot}/doc-files/types/xs_string.html">xs:string</a>)
  * @param text  The word or phrase to match. If multiple strings are specified, the query matches if any of the words or phrases match (or-query semantics).  (of <a href="{@docRoot}/doc-files/types/xs_string.html">xs:string</a>)
  * @param options  Options to this query. The default is ().  Options include:  "case-sensitive" A case-sensitive query. "case-insensitive" A case-insensitive query. "diacritic-sensitive" A diacritic-sensitive query. "diacritic-insensitive" A diacritic-insensitive query. "punctuation-sensitive" A punctuation-sensitive query. "punctuation-insensitive" A punctuation-insensitive query. "whitespace-sensitive" A whitespace-sensitive query. "whitespace-insensitive" A whitespace-insensitive query. "stemmed" A stemmed query. "unstemmed" An unstemmed query. "wildcarded" A wildcarded query. "unwildcarded" An unwildcarded query. "exact" An exact match query. Shorthand for "case-sensitive", "diacritic-sensitive", "punctuation-sensitive", "whitespace-sensitive", "unstemmed", and "unwildcarded".  "lang=iso639code" Specifies the language of the query. The iso639code code portion is case-insensitive, and uses the languages specified by ISO 639. The default is specified in the database configuration. "distance-weight=number" A weight applied based on the minimum distance between matches of this query. Higher weights add to the importance of proximity (as opposed to term matches) when the relevance order is calculated. The default value is 0.0 (no impact of proximity). The weight should be between 64 and -16. Weights greater than 64 will have the same effect as a weight of 64. This parameter has no effect if the word positions index is not enabled. This parameter has no effect on searches that use score-simple, score-random, or score-zero (because those scoring algorithms do not consider term frequency, proximity is irrelevant).  "min-occurs=number" Specifies the minimum number of occurrences required. If fewer that this number of words occur, the fragment does not match. The default is 1. "max-occurs=number" Specifies the maximum number of occurrences required. If more than this number of words occur, the fragment does not match. The default is unbounded. "synonym" Specifies that all of the terms in the $text parameter are considered synonyms for scoring purposes. The result is that occurrences of more than one of the synonyms are scored as if there are more occurrences of the same term (as opposed to having a separate term that contributes to score).  "lexicon-expand=value" The value is one of full, prefix-postfix, off, or heuristic (the default is heuristic). An option with a value of lexicon-expand=full specifies that wildcards are resolved by expanding the pattern to words in a lexicon (if there is one available), and turning into a series of cts:word-queries, even if this takes a long time to evaluate. An option with a value of lexicon-expand=prefix-postfix specifies that wildcards are resolved by expanding the pattern to the pre- and postfixes of the words in the word lexicon (if there is one), and turning the query into a series of character queries, even if it takes a long time to evaluate. An option with a value of lexicon-expand=off specifies that wildcards are only resolved by looking up character patterns in the search pattern index, not in the lexicon. An option with a value of lexicon-expand=heuristic, which is the default, specifies that wildcards are resolved by using a series of internal rules, such as estimating the number of lexicon entries that need to be scanned, seeing if the estimate crosses certain thresholds, and (if appropriate), using another way besides lexicon expansion to resolve the query.  "lexicon-expansion-limit=number" Specifies the limit for lexicon expansion. This puts a restriction on the number of lexicon expansions that can be performed. If the limit is exceeded, the server may raise an error depending on whether the "limit-check" option is set. The default value for this option will be 4096.  "limit-check" Specifies that an error will be raised if the lexicon expansion exceeds the specified limit. "no-limit-check" Specifies that error will not be raised if the lexicon expansion exceeds the specified limit. The server will try to resolve the wildcard.    (of <a href="{@docRoot}/doc-files/types/xs_string.html">xs:string</a>)
  * @param weight  A weight for this query. Higher weights move search results up in the relevance order. The default is 1.0. The weight should be between 64 and -16. Weights greater than 64 will have the same effect as a weight of 64. Weights less than the absolute value of 0.0625 (between -0.0625 and 0.0625) are rounded to 0, which means that they do not contribute to the score.

  * Returns a query matching json properties by name which has specific children representing latitude and longitude values for a point contained within the given geographic box, circle, or polygon, or equal to the given point. Points that lie between the southern boundary and the northern boundary of a box, travelling northwards, and between the western boundary and the eastern boundary of the box, travelling eastwards, will match. Points contained within the given radius of the center point of a circle will match, using the curved distance on the surface of the Earth. Points contained within the given polygon will match, using great circle arcs over a spherical model of the Earth as edges. An error may result if the polygon is malformed in some way. Points equal to the a given point will match, taking into account the fact that longitudes converge at the poles.

/**
  * Returns a query matching json properties by name which has specific property children representing latitude and longitude values for a point contained within the given geographic box, circle, or polygon, or equal to the given point. Points that lie between the southern boundary and the northern boundary of a box, travelling northwards, and between the western boundary and the eastern boundary of the box, travelling eastwards, will match. Points contained within the given radius of the center point of a circle will match, using the curved distance on the surface of the Earth. Points contained within the given polygon will match, using great circle arcs over a spherical model of the Earth as edges. An error may result if the polygon is malformed in some way. Points equal to the a given point will match, taking into account the fact that longitudes converge at the poles. Using the geospatial query constructors requires a valid geospatial license key; without a valid license key, searches that include geospatial queries will throw an exception.

An option with a value of lexicon-expand=off specifies that wildcards are only resolved by looking up character patterns in the search pattern index, not in the lexicon. An option with a value of lexicon-expand=heuristic, which is the default, specifies that wildcards are resolved by using a series of internal rules, such as estimating the number of lexicon entries that need to be scanned, seeing if the estimate crosses certain thresholds, and (if appropriate), using another way besides lexicon expansion to resolve the query.  * "lexicon-expansion-limit=number" Specifies the limit for lexicon expansion.

"min-occurs=number" Specifies the minimum number of occurrences required. If fewer that this number of words occur, the fragment does not match. The default is 1. "max-occurs=number" Specifies the maximum number of occurrences required. If more than this number of words occur, the fragment does not match. The default is unbounded. "synonym" Specifies that all of the terms in the $text parameter are considered synonyms for scoring purposes. The result is that occurrences of more than one of the synonyms are scored as if there are more occurrences of the same term (as opposed to having a separate term that contributes to score).  "lexicon-expand=value" The value is one of full, prefix-postfix, off, or heuristic (the default is heuristic). An option with a value of lexicon-expand=full specifies that wildcards are resolved by expanding the pattern to words in a lexicon (if there is one available), and turning into a series of cts:word-queries, even if this takes a long time to evaluate. An option with a value of lexicon-expand=prefix-postfix specifies that wildcards are resolved by expanding the pattern to the pre- and postfixes of the words in the word lexicon (if there is one), and turning the query into a series of character queries, even if it takes a long time to evaluate. An option with a value of lexicon-expand=off specifies that wildcards are only resolved by looking up character patterns in the search pattern index, not in the lexicon. An option with a value of lexicon-expand=heuristic, which is the default, specifies that wildcards are resolved by using a series of internal rules, such as estimating the number of lexicon entries that need to be scanned, seeing if the estimate crosses certain thresholds, and (if appropriate), using another way besides lexicon expansion to resolve the query.  * "lexicon-expansion-limit=number" Specifies the limit for lexicon expansion. This puts a restriction on the number of lexicon expansions that can be performed. If the limit is exceeded, the server may raise an error depending on whether the "limit-check" option is set. The default value for this option will be 4096.  "limit-check" Specifies that an error will be raised if the lexicon expansion exceeds the specified limit. "no-limit-check" Specifies that error will not be raised if the lexicon expansion exceeds the specified limit. The server will try to resolve the wildcard.

/**
  * Returns a query matching path expressions whose content represents a point contained within the given geographic box, circle, or polygon, or equal to the given point. Points that lie between the southern boundary and the northern boundary of a box, travelling northwards, and between the western boundary and the eastern boundary of the box, travelling eastwards, will match. Points contained within the given radius of the center point of a circle will match, using the curved distance on the surface of the Earth. Points contained within the given polygon will match, using great circle arcs over a spherical model of the Earth as edges. An error may result if the polygon is malformed in some way. Points equal to the a given point will match, taking into account the fact that longitudes converge at the poles. Using the geospatial query constructors requires a valid geospatial license key; without a valid license key, searches that include geospatial queries will throw an exception.

Shorthand for "case-sensitive", "diacritic-sensitive", "punctuation-sensitive", "whitespace-sensitive", "unstemmed", and "unwildcarded".  "lang=iso639code" Specifies the language of the query. The iso639code code portion is case-insensitive, and uses the languages specified by ISO 639. The default is specified in the database configuration. "distance-weight=number" A weight applied based on the minimum distance between matches of this query. Higher weights add to the importance of proximity (as opposed to term matches) when the relevance order is calculated. The default value is 0.0 (no impact of proximity). The weight should be between 64 and -16. Weights greater than 64 will have the same effect as a weight of 64. This parameter has no effect if the word positions index is not enabled. This parameter has no effect on searches that use score-simple, score-random, or score-zero (because those scoring algorithms do not consider term frequency, proximity is irrelevant).  "min-occurs=number" Specifies the minimum number of occurrences required. If fewer that this number of words occur, the fragment does not match. The default is 1. "max-occurs=number" Specifies the maximum number of occurrences required. If more than this number of words occur, the fragment does not match. The default is unbounded. "synonym" Specifies that all of the terms in the $text parameter are considered synonyms for scoring purposes. The result is that occurrences of more than one of the synonyms are scored as if there are more occurrences of the same term (as opposed to having a separate term that contributes to score).  "lexicon-expand=value" The value is one of full, prefix-postfix, off, or heuristic (the default is heuristic). An option with a value of lexicon-expand=full specifies that wildcards are resolved by expanding the pattern to words in a lexicon (if there is one available), and turning into a series of cts:word-queries, even if this takes a long time to evaluate. An option with a value of lexicon-expand=prefix-postfix specifies that wildcards are resolved by expanding the pattern to the pre- and postfixes of the words in the word lexicon (if there is one), and turning the query into a series of character queries, even if it takes a long time to evaluate. An option with a value of lexicon-expand=off specifies that wildcards are only resolved by looking up character patterns in the search pattern index, not in the lexicon. An option with a value of lexicon-expand=heuristic, which is the default, specifies that wildcards are resolved by using a series of internal rules, such as estimating the number of lexicon entries that need to be scanned, seeing if the estimate crosses certain thresholds, and (if appropriate), using another way besides lexicon expansion to resolve the query.  "lexicon-expansion-limit=number" Specifies the limit for lexicon expansion. This puts a restriction on the number of lexicon expansions that can be performed. If the limit is exceeded, the server may raise an error depending on whether the "limit-check" option is set. The default value for this option will be 4096.  "limit-check" Specifies that an error will be raised if the lexicon expansion exceeds the specified limit.
