= Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")

Thank you for your interest in an open source project administered by
the MarkLogic Corporation (the "Project"). This Agreement states the
terms under which you, the person listed below, may contribute to the
Project any software, modifications or additions, bug fixes,
documentation, or any other materials that you provide (whether
electronically, verbally, or in written form) to MarkLogic
Corporation ("MarkLogic" or "us") related to the Project (each a
"Contribution"). This license is for your protection as well as the
protection of MarkLogic and its licensees. This Agreement does not
otherwise change your rights to use your own Contributions for any
other purpose. Please complete the following information about you and
the Contributions and either (a) sign electronically by filling out
the form below or (b) sign and submit the form to the contact
information below.

If you develop software or create software code as a part of your
employment, or if your employer is in the business of developing
software, or otherwise may claim rights in the Contributions, please
provide information about your employer's policy on contributing to
open source projects below, including the name of the supervisor to
contact in connection with such contributions.

If you have questions about this Agreement, please contact us at
opensource@marklogic.com.

.You and MarkLogic acknowledge and agree:
. Control of the Project. We, in our sole discretion, determine the
  Contributions that will be included in the Project. You understand
  that this Agreement, and your submission of any Contribution, does
  not guarantee that any such Contributions will be included in the
  Project.
. License Grants. You hereby grant to MarkLogic, a perpetual,
  non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free and fully
  paid-up, sublicenseable, and transferable license under all of your
  relevant intellectual property rights (including copyright, patent,
  trade secret, and any other rights), to use, copy, modify, prepare
  derivative works of, distribute and publicly perform and publicly
  display your Contributions on any licensing terms, in our sole
  discretion, including without limitation: (a) the GNU General Public
  License, the GNU Lesser General Public License, the Common Public
  License, the MIT License, the Apache License, or the Berkeley
  Software Distribution license; and (b) binary, proprietary, or
  commercial licenses. You hereby grant to MarkLogic and to recipients
  of the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, fully-paid up
  and royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use,
  offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Project,
  where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by
  you that are necessarily infringed by your Contributions alone or by
  combination of your Contributions with the Project.
. Ownership. Except for the licenses granted herein, you reserve all
  right, title, and interest in and to your Contributions.
. Your Representations. You represent that you are able and entitled to
  grant us the above license rights. You represent that your
  Contributions are your original works of authorship, and to your
  knowledge, no other person claims, or has the right to claim, any
  right in any intellectual property right, including without
  limitation invention or patent rights, related to your Contributions.
  You also represent that you are not legally obligated, whether by
  entering into an agreement or otherwise, in any way that conflicts
  with the terms of the foregoing license grant. If your employer has
  rights to intellectual property that you create, you represent that
  you have received permission to make your Contributions on behalf of
  that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for your
  Contributions.
. No Implied Warranties. MarkLogic acknowledges that, except as
  explicitly described in this Agreement, your Contribution is
  provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
  ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
