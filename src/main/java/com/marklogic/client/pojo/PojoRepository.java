/** PojoRepository is the central class for the Pojo Facade.  It supports CRUD operations
 * and search.  Each PojoRepository instance operates on only one pojo class.  Create new
 * PojoRepository instances based on your custom pojo type like so:
 * <pre>    public class MyClass {
 *        {@literal @}Id
 *        public Integer getMyId() {
 *            ...
 *        }
 *        public void setMyId(Integer integer) {
 *            ...
 *        }
 *        ...
 *    }
 *    ...
 *    DatabaseClient client = ...;
 *    PojoRepository&lt;MyClass, Integer&gt; myClassRepo = 
 *        client.newPojoRepository(MyClass.class, Integer.class);</pre>
 *
 * Where MyClass is your custom pojo type, and myId is the bean property of type Integer
 * marked with the 
 * {@literal @}{@link Id Id annotation}.  The 
 * {@literal @}Id annotation can be attached to a public field or a public getter or a 
 * public setter.  The bean property marked with {@literal @}Id must be a native type or 
 * {@link java.io.Serializable} class and must contain an 
 * identifier value unique across all persisted instances of that
 * type or the instance will overwrite the persisted instance with the same identifier.
 *
 * The current implementation of the Pojo Facade uses 
 * <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/">Jackson databind</a> for serialization
 * and deserialization to json.  Thus only classes which can be serialized and deserialized 
 * directly by Jackson can be serialized by the Pojo Facade.  Every bean property
 * including the one marked with {@literal @}Id must either expose a public field or both a public 
 * getter and a public setter.  To test if your class can be directly serialized and 
 * deserialized by Jackson, perform the following:
 * <pre>    ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
 *    String value = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(myObjectIn);
 *    MyClass myObjectOut = objectMapper.readValue(value, MyClass.class);</pre>
 *
 * If that works but the configured objectMapper in the Pojo Facade is different and not
 * working, you can troubleshoot by directly accessing the objectMapper used by the Pojo 
 * Facade using an unsupported internal method attached to the current implementation: 
 * <a 
 * href="https://github.com/marklogic/java-client-api/blob/master/src/main/java/com/marklogic/client/impl/PojoRepositoryImpl.java"
 * >com.marklogic.client.impl.PojoRepositoryImpl</a>.
 * <pre>    ObjectMapper objectMapper = ((PojoRepositoryImpl) myClassRepo).getObjectMapper();</pre>
 *
 * If your class has properties which are classes (non-native types) they will be automatically 
 * serialized and deserialized, but cannot be written, read, or searched directly.  If you 
 * wish to directly write, read, or search another class, create a new instance of 
 * PojoRepository specific to that class.
 *
 * Since PojoRepository stores in JSON format, which limits number precision to 15
 * significant digits (IEEE754 double precision), you will lose precision on numbers
 * longer than 15 significant digits.  If you desire larger numbers with no loss of
 * precision, use Strings to persist those numbers.
