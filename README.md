# The MarkLogic Java Client API

The API makes it easy to write, read, delete, and find documents
in a [MarkLogic](http://developer.marklogic.com/) database.

For example:

    // write a text, binary, XML, or JSON document from any source with ACID guarantees
    documentManager.write(uri, new FileHandle()
      .with(new File("file1234.json"))
      .withFormat(JSON));

    // read and directly parse to your preferred type, even your own POJOs!
    JsonNode jsonDocContents = documentManager.readAs(uri, JsonNode.class);

    // get matches super-fast using full-featured search
    JsonNode results = queryManager.search(
      new StructuredQueryBuilder().term("quick", "brown", "fox"),
      new JacksonHandle()).get();

The Java API supports the following core features of the MarkLogic database:

*  Write and read binary, JSON, text, and XML documents.
*  Query data structure trees, marked-up text, and all the hybrids in between those extremes.
*  Project values, tuples, and triples from hierarchical documents and aggregate over them.
*  Patch documents with partial updates.
*  Match documents against alerting rules expressed as queries.
*  Use Optimistic Locking to detect contention without creating locks on the server.
*  Execute ACID modifications so the change either succeeds or throws an exception.
*  Execute multi-statement transactions so changes to multiple documents succeed or fail together.

### What's New in Java Client API 4

* Optic API - blends relational with NoSQL by providing joins and aggregates over documents
  * is powered by the new row index and query optimizer
  * uses row, triple, and/or lexicon lenses
  * matches the functionality of the Optic API for XQuery and Javascript, but idiomatic for Java
    developers
* Data Movement SDK - move large amounts of data into, out of, or within a MarkLogic cluster
  * WriteBatcher distributes writes across many threads and across the entire MarkLogic cluster
  * QueryBatcher enables bulk processing or export of matches to a query by distributing the query
    across many threads and batch processing to listeners
  * Comes with ApplyTransformListener, DeleteListener, ExportListener, ExportToWriterListener, and
    UrisToWriterListener
  * With custom listeners you can easily and efficiently apply your business logic to batches of query
    matches
* Kerberos and Client Certificate Authentication
* Geospatial double precision and queries on region indexes
* Temporal document enhancements
  * protect and wipe
  * more control over version uris
* Support for document metadata values

### QuickStart

To use the API in your maven project, include the following in your pom.xml:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.marklogic</groupId>
        <artifactId>marklogic-client-api</artifactId>
        <version>4.1.0</version>
    </dependency>

And add this repository to your pom.xml repositories section:

    <repository>
        <id>jcenter</id>
        <url>http://jcenter.bintray.com</url>
    </repository>

For gradle projects, include the following:

    dependencies {
        compile group: 'com.marklogic', name: 'marklogic-client-api', version: '4.1.0'
    }

Use gradle 1.7+ and add this to your build.gradle repositories section:

    jcenter()

* [JavaDoc](http://docs.marklogic.com/javadoc/client/index.html)

### Installing

To use the Java API, either add Maven or Gradle dependency as explained above or download the jar and its dependencies:

http://developer.marklogic.com/products/java

Of course, you'll also need to install the database -- which you can do for free with
the developer license:

https://developer.marklogic.com/free-developer

To obtain verified downloads signed with MarkLogic's PGP key, use maven tools or directly download
the .jar and .asc files from
[maven central](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/marklogic/marklogic-client-api/4.1.0/).  MarkLogic's
pgp key ID is 48D4B86E and it is available from pgp.mit.edu by installing gnupg and running the command:

    $ gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-key 48D4B86E

Files can be verified with the command:

    $ gpg marklogic-client-api-4.1.0.jar.asc


### Building and Contributing

You can build the API in the same way as any Gradle project on git:

1. Clone the java-client-api repository on your machine.
2. Choose the appropriate branch (usually develop)
3. Execute a Gradle build in the directory containing the main project's build.gradle file.

You might want to skip the tests until you have configured a test database and REST server:

    $ ./gradlew build -x test

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more on contributing to this github project.

### Running JUnit Tests

    $ ./gradlew java-client-api:compileTestJava
    $ ./gradlew testServerInit
    $ ./gradlew java-client-api:test
