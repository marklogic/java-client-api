To develop the Java Client and ultimately submit a pull request, you'll first need to be able to build the client and 
run the tests locally. 

Please see [this guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on creating and submitting a pull request.

To build the client locally, complete the following steps:

1. Clone this repository on your machine.
2. Choose the appropriate branch (usually develop)
3. Ensure you are using Java 8 or Java 11 or Java 17 (the JVM version used to compile should not matter as compiler flags
are set to ensure the compiled code will run on Java 8; Jenkins pipelines also exist to ensure that the tests pass on
Java 8, 11, and 17, and thus they should for you locally as well; note that if you load the project into an IDE, you
should use Java 8 in case your IDE does not process the build.gradle config that conditionally brings in JAXB dependencies
required by Java 9+.)
4. Verify that you can build the client by running `./gradlew build -x test`

"Running the tests" in the context of developing and submitting a pull request refers to running the tests found
in the `marklogic-client-api` module. The tests for this module depend on a 
[ml-gradle](https://github.com/marklogic-community/ml-gradle) application being deployed from the `test-app` module.
This application contains a number of database and security resources that the tests depend on.
The `./gradle.properties` file defines the connection properties for this application; these default
to `localhost` and an admin password of `admin`. To override these, create the file `./gradle-local.properties`
and add the following (you can override additional properties as necessary):

    mlHost=changeme
    mlPassword=changeme

Note that additional properties are defined via `./tests-app/gradle.properties`, though it is not expected that these
properties will need to be changed.

The tests require a MarkLogic instance with access to several ports (8000,8001,8002,8012,8014,8020). That instance may
be a local instance or it may be running in a Docker container. If you would like to create a Docker container with the
instance, you may create the container with the following commands (starting in the project root directory):

```
cd test-app
docker-compose up -d --build
cd ..
```

Once you have a MarkLogic instance ready, the application is then deployed via the following command:

    ./gradlew mlDeploy -i

You can then run the tests, which will use the values of `mlHost` and `mlPassword` for connecting to MarkLogic as an
admin user:

    ./gradlew marklogic-client-api:test

Individual tests can be run in the following manner (replace `GraphsTest` with the name of the test class you wish to run):

    ./gradlew marklogic-client-api:test --tests GraphsTest

Tests for the `ml-development-tools` Gradle plugin can be run via:

    ./gradlew ml-development-tools:test

You can also undeploy the test application if you do not wish to keep it around on your MarkLogic instance:

    ./gradlew mlUndeploy -i -Pconfirm=true

To test the `ml-development-tools` Gradle plugin, see the README.md file located at 
`ml-development-tools/src/test/example-project`.
