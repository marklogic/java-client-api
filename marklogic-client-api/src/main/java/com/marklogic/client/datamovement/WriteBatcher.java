/**
 * <p>To facilitate long-running write jobs, batches documents added by many
 * external threads and coordinates internal threads to send the batches
 * round-robin to all appropriate hosts in the cluster.  Appropriate hosts are
 * those containing a forest associated with the database for the
 * DatabaseClient provided to DataMovementManager.  Many external threads
 * (threads not managed by WriteBatcher) can concurrently add documents by
 * calling WriteBatcher {@link #add add} or {@link #addAs addAs}.  Each
 * time enough documents are added to make a batch, the batch is added to an
 * internal queue where the first available internal thread will pick it up and
 * write it to the server.  Since batches are not written until they are full,
 * you should always call {@link #flushAsync} or {@link #flushAndWait} when no
 * more documents will be written to ensure that any partial batch is written.</p>
 *
 * Sample Usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     WriteBatcher whb = dataMovementManager.newWriteBatcher()
 *         .withBatchSize(100)
 *         .withThreadCount(20)
 *         .onBatchSuccess(batch -> {
 *             logger.debug("batch # {}, so far: {}", batch.getJobBatchNumber(), batch.getJobWritesSoFar());
 *         })
 *         .onBatchFailure((batch,throwable) -> throwable.printStackTrace() );
 *     JobTicket ticket = dataMovementManager.startJob(whb);
 *     whb.add  ("doc1.txt", new StringHandle("doc1 contents"));
 *     whb.addAs("doc2.txt", "doc2 contents");
 *
 *     whb.flushAndWait(); // send the two docs even though they're not a full batch
 *     dataMovementManager.stopJob(ticket);
 *}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Note: All Closeable content or metadata handles passed to {@link #add add}
 * methods will be closed as soon as possible (after the batch is written).
 * This is to avoid IO resource leakage.  This differs from the normal usage of
 * the Java Client API because WriteBatcher is asynchronous so there's no
 * easy way to know which handles have finished writing and can therefore be
 * closed.  So to save confusion we close all handles for you.  If you have a
 * resource that must be closed after a batch is written, but is not closed by
 * your handle, override the close method of any Closeable handle and close
 * your resource there.</p>
