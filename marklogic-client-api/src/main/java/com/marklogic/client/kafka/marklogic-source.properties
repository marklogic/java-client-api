# A MarkLogic host to connect to. The connector uses the Data Movement SDK, and thus it will connect to each of the
# hosts in a cluster.

# The port of a REST API server to connect to.

# Optional - the name of a database to connect to. If your REST API server has a content database matching that of the
# one that you want to write documents to, you do not need to set this.

# Optional - set to "gateway" when using a load balancer, else leave blank. See https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/java/data-movement#id_26583 for more information.

# Set to "true" for a "simple" SSL strategy that uses the JVM's default SslContext and X509TrustManager and a

# Sets the number of documents to be written in a batch to MarkLogic. This may not have any impact depending on the
# connector receives data from Kafka, as the connector calls flushAsync on the DMSDK WriteBatcher after processing every
# collection of records. Thus, if the connector never receives at one time more than the value of this property, then
# the value of this property will have no impact.

# Sets the number of threads used by the Data Movement SDK for parallelizing writes to MarkLogic. Similar to the batch
# size property above, this may never come into play depending on how many records the connector receives at once.
